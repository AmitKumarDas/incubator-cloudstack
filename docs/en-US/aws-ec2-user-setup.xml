  <para>In general, users need not be aware that they are using a translation service provided by &PRODUCT;.

    Users of the Amazon EC2 compatible interface will be able to keep their existing EC2 tools
    and scripts and use them with their &PRODUCT; deployment, by specifying the endpoint of the
    management server and using the proper user credentials. In order to do this, each user must
