  <title>Amazon Web Services EC2 Compatible Interface</title>
    <para>&PRODUCT; can translate Amazon Web Services (AWS) API calls to native &PRODUCT; API calls
    so that users can continue using existing AWS-compatible tools. This translation service runs as
    a separate web application in the same tomcat server as the management server of &PRODUCT;,
    listening on the same port. This Amazon EC2-compatible API is accessible through a SOAP web
    service.</para> 
    <note>
      <para>This service was previously enabled by separate software called CloudBridge. It is now
      fully integrated with the &PRODUCT; management server. </para>

        <para>If you need to support features such as elastic IP, set up a Citrix NetScaler to provide this service. The commands such as ec2-associate-address will not work without EIP setup. Users running VMs in this zone will be using the NetScaler-enabled network offering (DefaultSharedNetscalerEIP and ELBNetworkOffering).</para>
