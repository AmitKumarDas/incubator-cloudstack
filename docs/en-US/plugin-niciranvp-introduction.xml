    <title>Introduction to the Nicira NVP Plugin</title>
    <para>The Nicira NVP plugin allows CloudStack to use the Nicira solution for virtualized network as a provider for CloudStack networks and services.</para>
    <!--
    <para>Always use &PRODUCT; rather than typing CloudStack or CloudPlatform.</para>
    <para>Indent with 4 spaces, not with tab characters.</para>
    <para>To hyperlink to a URL outside this document: <ulink url="http://external URL here">Display text of the link here</ulink></para>
    <para>To hyperlink to another section in this document: <xref linkend="SECTION-ID-OF-THE-OTHER-SECTION-GOES-HERE." />
        The publication tools will automatically insert the display text of the link for you.</para>
    <note><para>Use this for all tips and asides. Don't use other tags such as tip.
        Our publication tool (publican) prefers the note tag. The tool will 
        automatically insert the text NOTE: for you, so please don't type it.</para></note>
    <warning><para>Use this for anything that is vital to avoid runtime errors. Don't use
        other tags such as caution. Our publication tool (publican) prefers the warning tag. The tool will
        automatically insert the text WARNING: for you, so please don't type it.</para></warning>
    <para>Here's how to do a bulleted list:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Bulleted list item text.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Here's how to do a numbered list. These are used for step by step instructions 
        or to describe a sequence of events in time. For everything else, use a bulleted list.</para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>Text of the step</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>You might also want a sub-list within one of the list items. Like this:</para>
            <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
                <listitem><para>Inner list item text.</para></listitem>
            </orderedlist>
        </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Here's how to insert an image. Put the graphic file in /images, a subdirectory of the directory where this XML file is.
        Refer to it using this tag. The tag is admittedly complex, but it's the one we need to use with publican:</para>
    <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="./images/YOUR_FILENAME_HERE.png" />
        </imageobject>
        <textobject><phrase>YOUR_FILENAME_HERE.png: Alt text describing this image, such as 
            “structure of a zone.” Required for accessibility.</phrase></textobject>
    </mediaobject>
    <para>A section can contain sub-sections. Please make each sub-section a separate file to enable reuse.
        Then include the sub-section like this:</para>
    <xi:include href="SUBSECTION_FILE_NAME.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
